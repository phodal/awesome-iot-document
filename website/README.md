##IETF CoAP协议

[Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) draft-ietf-core-coap-18](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18)

>  The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
   transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
   (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit
   microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained
   networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a
   typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for
   machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
   building automation.
